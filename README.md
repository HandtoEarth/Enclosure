# Some Notes About My Process

What follows are some notes about my process in developing this quick start document, the of the challenges, and my decisions along the way.  

 + I heavily relied on the Install, Admin, and User manuals available for ownCloud, and reused much of content since it made sense to do so. I did a lot of editing with an eye to making it consistent. Let's hear it for single-sourcing and modular documentation! The challenge of course was what to use, and when to refer to external sources. I hope I did a reasonable job. 
 + I was limited my level of knowledge about system administration. Setting up the server and defining the port was particularly challenging, and this in particular is where I would have consulted a SME. I think I got it sort of right? I hope so. I included all of the Proxy parameters in the documentation, though it looks like the user can configure settings or leave the default settings in place, as needed.
 + I would say the bulk of my time was spent reviewing the ownCloud documentation and doing my best to get to know the software without actually installing it myself. Ideally I would do all of this and actually do my own install. :-)
 + Markdown is fun. Jekyll is awesome.
 
 Thanks for your time and attention! This was an interesting assignment and I really look forward to the next part of the conversation!
 
 Yours,
