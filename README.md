# Some Notes About My Process

What follows are some notes about my process in developing this quick start document, the of the challenges, and my decisions along the way.  

 + I heavily relied on the Install, Admin, and User manuals available for ownCloud, and reused content since it made sense to do so. Let's hear it for single-sourcing and modular documentation! The challenge of course was what to use, and when to refer to external sources. I hope I did a reasonable job! 
 + I was limited my level of knowledge about system administration-- setting up the server and defining the port was particularly challenging and is where I would have consulted a SME. I think I got it sort of right? I hope so anyway. I included all of the Proxy parameters in the documentation, though it looks like the user can configure them as needed or leave their default settings in place.
 + For the user guide story, I included how to install the Desktop client only just to preserve some brevity. I was not able to find instructions on exactly how the user would access the server using the client. Ideally I would include that information.
 + I'm pretty handy with Github, but this was my first time using Jekyll! I found a nice YouTube video that walked me through the installation. It was very simple.
 + Markdown was also fun and simpole to learn very fast. For speed, I used an online Markdown editor called Dillinger.
 +I would say the bulk of my time was spent reviewing the ownCloud documentation and doing my best to get to know the software without actually installing it myself. Ideally I would do all of this and actually do my own install. :-)
 
 Thanks for your time and attention! This was an interesting assignment and I really look forward to the next part of the conversation!
 
 Yours,
